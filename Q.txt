0.what are main benefits of Devops?
--release velocity(we can release code to prod more often and with more confidence)
--Developemt cycle(the complte SDLC from intial design to prod deployment become shorter)
--deployment rollback(we plan for any failure in deployment rollbck due to a bug in code or issue in prod.
this gives confidence in releasing feature without worring about downtime for rollback.
--defect detection(we can catch defects much earlier than releasing to prod.it improves the quality of the software.
--recovery from failure
--collabaration.
--performance oriented.

19.bare repository?
A: A repo is created with git init -bare cmd is a bare repo in git.
bare repo does not contain any working or checked out copy of source files.a bare repo stores git revision history in the root folder of repo instead of in a .git subfolder.
it is mainainly used for sharing and collaborating with other devopers.
we can create a bare repo in which all devolpoers can push their code.
there is no working dir since no one directly edits files in a bare repo.
20.how to put local repo on github server?
21.git clone vs git remote add?
22.Git stash?
23.git pull vs git fetch?
24.apache vs tomcat?
A:In simple words, Apache is a web-server meant to serve static web-pages. ... 
Apache Tomcat, on the other hand, is an application server meant to serve Java applications (Servlets, JSPs etc). You can serve web-pages as well through Tomcat, but it is less efficient at that as compared to Apache. IRCTC is one such website.

16.Have you exp. on cloud formation?
17.Scripts are there of cloud formation,but if we want to customize them(ec2,vpc,bastionhost,private subnets etc.),how good are you in that?
18.Have you ever create private and public subnets in VPC? i want a private web server,and that should be logged in through a bastion host?
A:Amazon VPC enables you to launch AWS resources on a virtual private network that you have defined. The bastion host runs on an Amazon EC2 instance that is typically in a public subnet of your Amazon VPC. 
Linux instances are in a subnet that is not publicly accessible, and they are set up with a security group that allows SSH access from the security group attached to the underlying EC2 instance running the bastion host. 
Bastion host users connect to the bastion host to connect to the Linux instances, as illustrated in the following diagram.
19.what is bastion host? and how to do above thing?
A:A bastion host is a server whose purpose is to provide access to a private network from an external network, such as the Internet. 
Because of its exposure to potential attack, a bastion host must minimize the chances of penetration.
For example, you can use a bastion host to mitigate the risk of allowing SSH connections from an external network to the Linux instances launched in a private subnet of your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).

22.What is CORS? (in S3)
A:Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) defines a way for client web applications that are loaded in one domain to interact with resources in a different domain. ... The subtopics describe how you can enable CORS using the Amazon S3 console, or programmatically by using the Amazon S3 REST API and the AWS SDKs.

they affect system performance, and you cannot interrupt them, but control returns to Tivoli Storage Manager when the nfstimeout value is reached.
Soft mount:--
If the NFS file system is soft mounted, NFS tries repeatedly to contact the server until either:
A connection is established
The NFS retry threshold is met
The nfstimeout value is reached

Difference btw yum and rpm?

In very short terms, YUM will install a full application, along with ALL its dependencies that are needed for it to run (libraries, other applications, etc) whereas RPM installs a SINGLE package file that you downloaded. RPM will error out when installing a package that has other dependencies if they are not present, whereas YUM will go get them and present them for your confirmation to install.

1.diff shell and command in ansible?
It is almost exactly like the command module but runs the command through a shell (/bin/sh) on the remote node.
For Windows targets, use the win_shell module instead.
ex:
- name: Execute the command in remote shell; stdout goes to the specified file on the remote.
  shell: somescript.sh >> somelog.txt

- name: Change the working directory to somedir/ before executing the command.
  shell: somescript.sh >> somelog.txt
  args:
    chdir: somedir/


The given command will be executed on all selected nodes. It will not be processed through the shell, so variables like $HOME and operations like "<", ">", "|", ";" and "&" will not work (use the shell module if you need these features).
For Windows targets, use the win_command module instead.
ex:
- name: return motd to registered var
  command: cat /etc/motd
  register: mymotd

- name: Run the command if the specified file does not exist.
  command: /usr/bin/make_database.sh arg1 arg2
  args:
    creates: /path/to/database

# You can also use the 'args' form to provide the options.
- name: This command will change the working directory to somedir/ and will only run when /path/to/database doesn't exist.
  command: /usr/bin/make_database.sh arg1 arg2
  args:
    chdir: somedir/
    creates: /path/to/database



SSL proxy:
ssl/tl---
yum install httpd(package)
yum install mod_ssl
yum install openssl(package is used for generating a selft saint cerificate)
openssl genrsa -out ca.key 2048(private key with 048 encryption)
openssl req -new -key ca.key -out ca.csr 
openssl x5049 -req -days 365 -in ca.csr -signkey ca.key -out ca.crt
we need copy these certficates to necessary dirs
cp ca.key /etc/pk1/tls/certs
cp ca.csr /etc/pk1/tls/certs
cp ca.crt /etc/pk1/tls/certs

vim /etc/hhtpd/conf.d/ssl.conf(we need to overrite the certificates files)
vim /etc/hhtpd/conf.d/httpd.conf(we need to conf the apache seervere)
<virtualHost *:443>
 SSLEngine
 SSLCerficatefile path
   SSLCerficatekeyfile path
   SSLSevername
   Document root
</VH>
then we need to add in the firewall

firewall-cmd --permanet --add-service=https
firewall-cmd --permanet --add-port=44
firewall-cmd --reload
after that we need restart the service
systemctl restart httpd.service
systemctl enable  httpd.service

1.git stash:
2.git stage:
3.git clone vs git remote:
4.git bare repository?
git init --bare
the bare repository does not contain any working or checked out copy of source files.a bare repo stores git revision history in the root folder of repo instead of in a .get subfolder.
it is mainly used for sharing and collaborating with other develpors.we can create bare repo in which all developers can push their code.
5.git vs svn?




Wipro:
1.have you worked on Networking in Docker?
2.what is docker-compose?
3.how to get the ip of container?
A:go to container and give like "ifconfig" or docker inspect cid or Hostname -I
Add this shell script in your ~/.bashrc or relevant file:

docker-ip() {
  docker inspect --format '{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress }}' "$@"
}
Then, to get an IP address of a container, simply do this:

docker-ip YOUR_CONTAINER_ID

5.how to check logs for container?
6.where the docker images are stored on host machine?
A:/var/lib/docker/
The contents of the /var/lib/docker directory vary depending on the driver Docker is using for storage.

By default this will be aufs but can fall back to overlay, overlay2, btrfs, devicemapper or zfs depending on your kernel support. In most places this will be aufs but the RedHats went with devicemapper.

You can manually set the storage driver with the -s or --storage-driver= option to the Docker daemon.

/var/lib/docker/{driver-name} will contain the driver specific storage for contents of the images.
/var/lib/docker/graph/<id> now only contains metadata about the image, in the json and layersize files.
In the case of aufs:

/var/lib/docker/aufs/diff/<id> has the file contents of the images.
/var/lib/docker/repositories-aufs is a JSON file containing local image information. This can be viewed with the command docker images.
In the case of devicemapper:

/var/lib/docker/devicemapper/devicemapper/data stores the images
/var/lib/docker/devicemapper/devicemapper/metadata the metadata

10.tell me about NATgateway?
11.you have a content management system running on an amazone ec2 instance that is approaching 100% CPU utilization.which option will reduce load on that insatnce?
A:Creating alone autoscaling group will not solve the problem,until uou attach a loadbalancer to it.once you attach LB to its your autoscaling group,it will efficiently distribute the load among all the instances

pricing(1 yr)---691$/monthly--Mumbai(0.9$ hourly)
             ---480$/monthly--N.V(0.6$ hourly)
latency--from USA to India --low
--------from India to USA---high
mostly we have to focus on pricing and perforamnce.better to choose N.V

10.how many types of instances are there and explain each one in detail in aws?
--spot instance
---on demand instance
--reserved instance

13.what is Elastic IP and compare to Normal IP's?
14.Is EIP address  enough for every instance that i have running?
15.what are the best practises for Security in AWS Ec2?
A:several practises are there to secure AWS Ec2.
1.use IAM to control access to ur AWS resouces.
2.restrict access by allowing trusted hosts or network to access ports on ur instance.
3.review the Rules in your security Groups regularly and ensure that you apply the principles of least.
4.privilege --only open up permissions that u require.
5.Disabled passwd based login when you lauch instance from your AMI.password can be found or cracked and are a security risk.

16.You need to configure AWS S3 bucket to serve static assets for your public facing web application.which method will you ensure that all the objects are uploaded that are set to public read?
A: all object are public read policy for S3 Bucket.
17.A customer wants to levarage AWS S#=3 and Glacier as part of their back-up and archive infrastructure.the customer uses third party tools to access them so which approcah
will use?
A:A Cusomer IAM user policy limited to AWS S3 API in "company-backup".
18.when you need to move data over long distance  using internet ,for the instance across contires or contnets of ur aws s3 bucket which method will use?
A:Amazon Glacier--archive serving
  Amazone CloudFront--content delivery network(CDN) ,it is data transfer tool therefore will not reduce the load on ec2 instance.
  amazone transfer acceleration--basicalyy acceleration your tansfer using CDN (right answer)
  Amazone snowball--when huge amount date to be tansffered  over long distance not across countries but only in USA.
19.Is it possible to change the private IP addresses of an ec2 while it is running/stopped?
A:Primary private IP address is attached with instance throughout its lifetime and cannot be changed howerever seconday private can be changed and unsasigned or assigned or moved between Interfaces or instances at any point.
20.In CloudFront what happens when content is NOT present at edge location and a request made to it?
A:CF delivers the content directly from origin server and stores it in the cache of edge location.
21.If AWS Direct connect fails,will i lose my connectivity?
22.if i launch a standby RDS instance,will be in the same AZ as a primary?
A: No,standby is to avoid an infra failure therefore it stores in Different AZ.

1.what is difference between Mysql and DynomoDB/
2.what is Amazon Aurora?why comapnies are choosing?
6.what are plugins used in jenkins in your project and explain them?
4.what is CI/CD process are you following in your current project?
5.what is lambada?
6.what happens to my backups and DB snapshots,if i delete my DB backup?
A:when you delete a DB instance,you have an option of creating a final DB snapshot,if you do that you can restore ur database from that snapshot.RDS retains the user-created DB snapshots along with other manually created DB 
snapshots after the instance is deleted,also automated backups are deleted and only manually created DB snapshots are retained.
7.suppose you have an application where you have to render images and also do some general computing.then which service is best?how?
A:application load balancer because it supports path based routing,which can take decision based on the URL if your task needs image rendering it will route it to different instance,and for general computing it will route it to a different instance.
8.what is difference btw scalability and elasticity?
A:scalability is the ability of a system to increase to hardware resources to handle in demand.it can be done by increaing the hardware specifications.
Elasticity is is the ability of a system to increase to workload by adding additional hardware resources when the demand increase but also rolling back the scaled resouces when the resources are nolonger needed.this is helpful in cloud envirnment when a pay per user model is followed.
9.how will u change the instance type of instance which are running in your application tier and are using autoscaling.where will u change it from?
A:Autoscaling lauch configuration.
Autoscaling tags configuration is used to attach metadata to your instances.
10.what is conneection draining do?
A:conneection draining is service under ELB which constantly monitors the health of the instances.if any instance fails a health checks or any instance has to be patched with a software update,it pulls all the traffic from that instance and re routes them to other instances.
11.when an instance is unhealthy,it is terminated and replaced with a new one,which service is best?
A:Fault tolerance.
Eg:when an ELB detects that an instance is unhealthy,it starts routing the incoming traffic to other healthy instances which are in the region.
if all the instances become unhealthy in the region and if you have some other AZ/region,your traffic is detected to them ,once your instance become healthy again,they are routed back to the original instances.

12.A user has setop an ASG,due to some issue it got failed to lauch a single instance from more than 24 hours what ASG will do in the condition?
A:ASG will suspend the scalling process.
13.you have an ec2 SG with severl runing ec2 instances,you changed the SG rules to allow inbound tarffic on new ports and protocal,and then launched new instances in the SG.the rules apply for what?
A:any rule specified in the SG applies immedaitely to all the instances.
14.Disaster Recovery?
DR invloves a set of policies and procedures to enable the recovery or continuation of vital technology infrastructre and systems following a natural or human induced distaster.
DR focuses on the IT or Technology systems supporting critical busisess fuctions.
